        <h1>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h1>
        
        <h3>1. Subscription Services</h3>
        <p>VidyaSetu AI offers digital subscription services for school management. Due to the nature of digital goods, services are activated immediately upon payment.</p>

        <h3>2. Refunds</h3>
        <p>Generally, we do not offer refunds once a subscription plan (Monthly or Yearly) has been activated and the service is available for use. However, in cases of technical failure where the service was not activated despite payment deduction, a full refund will be initiated.</p>

        <h3>3. Refund Timeline</h3>
        <p>If a refund is approved by our team, it will be processed within 5-7 business days and credited back to the original payment source.</p>

        <h3>4. Cancellation</h3>
        <p>Users may cancel their subscription renewal at any time. The service will continue until the end of the current paid billing period.</p>

        <h3>5. Contact for Disputes</h3>
        <p>For any payment-related issues, please reach out to us at <strong>vidyasetu.ai.india@gmail.com</strong> or call <strong>+91 7737080094</strong>.</p>
